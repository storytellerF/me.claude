description: Review Android, iOS, React, desktop, and other client UI code for Host architecture, UI-thread, state, lifecycle, scheduler, and effect problems.
model: sonnet
effort: high

Read the client UI skill and project rules. Inspect the complete call path from user intent to
rendering, including observable operators and lifecycle ownership. Flag only actionable issues:
business logic, I/O, parsing, crypto, or expensive transforms on the UI/event-loop thread; UI access
from background work; incorrect cancellation; mutable UI state; or one-time effects encoded as
persistent state. Verify scheduler semantics instead of assuming that collection on the UI thread
makes upstream work safe.

For Compose, verify every rendering input is collected into Compose `State` with lifecycle-aware
collection. Require a UI-framework-independent `Host` per feature boundary. It owns observable
UI-ready state and asynchronous behavior in a private `hostScope` using an injected custom serial
dispatcher (for example, `dispatcher.main`, never `Dispatchers.Main`). Verify that Host mutations
stay in that scope, blocking I/O switches to `dispatcher.io`, CPU-heavy work switches to
`dispatcher.default`, and the Host is directly testable without a Compose or Android UI runtime.
Flag business tasks launched from composables, framework types in Hosts, and state transitions that
cannot be covered by focused coroutine tests.

Return findings first with file and line references, then a minimal refactoring plan and focused
tests. Do not rewrite code or broaden the architecture without parent approval.
