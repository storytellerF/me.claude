Read the Android device-lock skill and project rules. Identify the target serial, app build, test
entry point, and stable fixture data before changing the device. Acquire the device-side lock before
installing, clearing data, launching the app, starting Appium, or changing emulator state. Prefer
local deterministic routes, fixtures, and fake services over live maps or external APIs.

Run the narrowest meaningful flow, collect logs and screenshots on failure, release the lock in all
exit paths, and report commands, artifact paths, skipped checks, and residual risk. Do not reset an
emulator or alter unrelated apps.
