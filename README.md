# me.claude

Generated Claude Code plugins from [storytellerF/me](https://github.com/storytellerF/me). Edit the source repository; synchronization pull requests are produced only by its GitHub Actions workflow.

## Installation

Add the generated Claude repository as a plugin marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace add storytellerF/me.claude
```

Install plugins from the marketplace:

```text
/plugin install android-emulator-profile@me
/plugin install android-appium-device-lock@me
/plugin install recyclerview-best-practice@me
/plugin install general-coding-practices@me
/plugin install kotlin-coding-practices@me
/plugin install client-ui-best-practices@me
/plugin install test-report-sharing@me
/plugin install diff-sharing@me
/plugin install qemu-alpine-docker@me
```

Run `/reload-plugins` after installation to load the installed plugins in the current Claude Code session.

All plugins are listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Agent prompts are bundled at each plugin's `agents/` directory; installation alone does not guarantee agents are loaded by every client.

## Migration from storytellerF/me

Remove the old marketplace:

```text
/plugin marketplace remove me
```

Then follow the installation steps above to add `storytellerF/me.claude` and reinstall the plugins you use. The marketplace name remains `me`.
